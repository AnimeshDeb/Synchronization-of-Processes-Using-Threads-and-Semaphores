The problem that is addressed concerns 3 smoker processes and 1 agent process. In order to smoke, each of the smoke processes needs tobacco, paper, and matches. Each of the smoker processes has only one of the above items starting off. Additionally, there is also an agent process, which has an infinite supply of all of the items -tobacco, matches, and paper. The agent process randomly places two of the three above items on a table and the smoker process that has the last remaining item then takes the items on the table and smokes. After the items on the table have been taken, the agent process places another two of the three items raandomly and the cycle continues like this. 
This problem is completed using the C language, and is accomplished using two different ways. One of the method that is used is semaphores and the other method that is used is pthreads. In these ways, multiple processes are taken into account. It should be said that a sem.h file is provided so that the two c files can run their programs.
